  То, что надо запомнить:

  <h2 class="post__small-heading">The Component Lifecycle</h2>

  Each component has several "lifecycle methods" that you can override
  to run code at particular times in the process. Methods prefixed with
  will are called right before something happens, and methods
  prefixed with did are called right after something happens.

  **Mounting**

  These methods are called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

  ```javascript
  constructor()
  ```

  ```javascript
  componentWillMount()
  ```

  ```javascript
  render()
  ```

  ```javascript
  componentDidMount()
  ```

  **Updating**

  An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called when a component is being re-rendered:

  ```javascript
  componentWillReceiveProps()
  shouldComponentUpdate()
  componentWillUpdate()
  render()
  componentDidUpdate()
  ```

  **Unmounting**
  This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

  ```javascript
  componentWillUnmount()
  ```
