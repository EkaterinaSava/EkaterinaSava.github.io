То, что надо запомнить:

<h2 class="post__small-heading">The Component Lifecycle</h2>

Each component has several "lifecycle methods" that you can override
to run code at particular times in the process. Methods prefixed with
will are called right before something happens, and methods
prefixed with did are called right after something happens.

#### Mounting

These methods are called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:


    constructor()
    componentWillMount()
    render()
    componentDidMount()


#### Updating

An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called when a component is being re-rendered:

    componentWillReceiveProps()
    shouldComponentUpdate()
    componentWillUpdate()
    render()
    componentDidUpdate()

#### Unmounting

This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

    componentWillUnmount()
